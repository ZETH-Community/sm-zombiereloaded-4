Q: Why this zombiereloaded existed?

A: I just wanna work on zombie:reloaded that have a new syntax. Say that srcdslab version did a pretty good job bringing zombie:reloaded with new syntax. Thanks to them it's now possible to zr plugin finally work with sourcemod 1.12 legit witout have to use old complier. 

List that I have been work with.
- ZVolume (You can change Zombie volume, Ambient Volume "separately".)
- Knockback API
- ZMarket API
- Actual weapon knockback for csgo.
- Fix last human not turn into zombie.
