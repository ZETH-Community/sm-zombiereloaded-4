# sm-zombiereloaded-3
Zombie:Reloaded for SourceMod (all versions up to 3.x)

Q: Why this zombiereloaded existed?

A: This version of zr plugin is mean to be remain original as much as possible (with new syntax). I say that anubis contributed some how has make thing much complicated than it should be. Second answer is because I just need something to do for making time pass faster, so this thing existed.
